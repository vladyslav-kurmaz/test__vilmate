# Test Task - 100 Blocks

This is a test task in which you are required to create 100 blocks, each with a height of 100 pixels, using pure JavaScript. When a block is clicked, it should be moved to the top of the list, and when clicked again, it should return to its original position.

## Repository

Link to the repository with the code: [https://github.com/vladyslav-kurmaz/test__vilmate](https://github.com/vladyslav-kurmaz/test__vilmate)

## Deployed Project

You can view the deployed project at the following link: [https://test-vilmate.vercel.app/](https://test-vilmate.vercel.app/)

## Logic and Interface

JavaScript is used for the logic, while HTML and CSS are used for the interface. Additionally, the ability to switch between list and grid view has been implemented.

### Running the Project Locally

If you want to run the project locally without installing any additional dependencies, you can use the Go Live extension in your code editor. Here are the steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Open the main HTML file of the project (e.g., index.html) in your code editor.
3. Find the "Go Live" option in your editor (usually available in the context menu of the HTML file or in the toolbar).
4. Select the "Go Live" option, and your project will open in a browser window.

This allows you to run the project locally without the need for a server or dependencies. With the Go Live extension, you will be able to see and interact with the created blocks.
